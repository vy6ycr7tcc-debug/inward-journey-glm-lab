   the tarot cards… almost like you scan them, but then the background is empty… the traces,
   they are glowy"). Each card's own drawing, traced from his Ra tarot photos by
   tools/build-card-glyphs.py (the line in the luminance channel, a soft glow round it in alpha),
   stands upright where its being stands: gold line warming into the archetype's colour, a halo
   of that colour about it, breathing, a slow band of light rising through it; brighter as you
