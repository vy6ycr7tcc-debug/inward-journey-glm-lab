/* Landmarks across the open world: the seven forms (beam and ring, pillars and veil, spiral
   garden, throne, arch, crossing rings, the chariot and its road). Each is home to its
   archetype's being (beings.ts). Each responds to the wanderer's presence as they pass;
   the quiet ones (veil, throne) open further when the wanderer is still nearby. Nothing waits
   to be used, and nothing needs to be finished. */
