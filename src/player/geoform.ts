/* In flight the wanderer becomes a geometric being (Samuel: "more like a geometric shape
   shifting… very geometric… something very alien"), as in the water it becomes an orb.
   - A faceted core, flat-shaded glass whose facets catch the light in their own pale colours,
     never still: its vertices rise and sink in travelling waves, so it keeps shifting between
     stellated, spiked and rounded forms.
   - Around it, the edges of two other solids (an octahedron and a dodecahedron), turning on
     their own axes against each other, swelling and shrinking in turn, so now one form leads,
     now another.
   Contained, as every glow here: only thin edges and a soft core. */
