/* A journey: a monument's rooms walked one after another, in a place apart beyond the world's
   edge (x = 22000, as the temple is at 30000). Only one room exists at a time: crossing a door,
   the screen goes pitch black, the room behind is taken down, the next is built in the dark, you
   stand at its start, and its recording begins. Every door is always open: walk through it
   whenever you like, whether the voice has finished or not (the owner: never locked, never gated
   on narration).

   The rooms are the factory modules in scenes/densities (and later the adept's, past choices',
   the visions'), built as they are: each is placed here by moving whatever it added to the scene;
   nothing inside a room is changed. A room that brings no air of its own gets a quiet one. */
