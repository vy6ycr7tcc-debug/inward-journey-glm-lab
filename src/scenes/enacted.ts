/* An enacted lesson (the owner, 2026-09-30: the lessons' little symbols at a distance were "small,
   flat, and disconnected from what the words are saying"). A stone seat, and before it a stage that
   fills the view: one continuous scene at full scale that does what the narration says (a knot
   that unties, a coal that burns, a lantern that lights three steps of the dark), always moving,
   its biggest moments given the most weight. Sitting starts the recording; the stage follows its
   clock (a pure function of narration seconds, eased); standing up it settles back into its
   waiting state. Only drawn within reach of the seat.

   The stage's own frame: its foot on the ground, the seat `reach` metres toward +z (so the one
   seated looks toward −z), x to the seated one's right. */
