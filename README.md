# Inward Journey

A contemplative third-person exploration game about Mind, Body and Spirit.
The brief is `prompts/master-build-prompt.md`; `CLAUDE.md` records how it's being applied; `PLAYTEST.md` says how to play the current build.

## Develop

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # serves on your LAN too; open the "Network" URL on the iPhone
npm run build      # typecheck + production build into dist/
npm run preview    # serve the production build on the LAN
```

## Deploy

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds and publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`
(or by hand from the Actions tab). One-time setup: repository **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**.
The site then lives at `https://vy6ycr7tcc-debug.github.io/Animation/`.

The build uses a relative base, so `dist/` also works as-is on Netlify, Vercel or any static host.

## Layout

- `src/main.ts`: renderer and post-processing, world setup, input, UI wiring, the frame loop
- `src/core/`: audio (water bed, tones, one-shots), narration and subtitles, the background playlist, input, save, adaptive quality, asset loading
- `src/world/`: sky, water, reflection, streamed terrain, landmarks (the station forms), beings (the archetypes you meet), life (grass, flowers, lanterns, butterflies, gliders), creation (trees and roots, rocks, crystals, spirits, the network of light), etched linework, atmosphere (mist, far hills), motes
- `src/ui/map.ts`: the map you begin from
- `src/player/`: the wanderer (recorded animation, fluid body, motes, ribbons), controller, camera, footprints
- `content/`: narration catalogue with subtitle cues, station data, scripts
- `public/`: audio and the wanderer's skeleton and animations
- `prompts/`, `reference/`, `narration/`, `prototype/`: briefs and source material
