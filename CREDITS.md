# Credits

- **Narration and water ambience:** from Samuel's game package (`prompts/GAME_PROMPT.md`). The scripts are inspired by the L/L Research channeling archive (llresearch.org).
- **The wanderer's body and motion:** the mannequin and animations from the Universal Animation Library by Quaternius (quaternius.com), CC0 1.0. It was taken from the glTF mirror at github.com/J-Ponzo/gltf-universal-animation-library, then reduced, compressed and recoloured as light for this game (`public/models/wanderer.glb`).
- **Engine:** three.js (MIT), postprocessing by pmndrs (Zlib), meshoptimizer and glTF-Transform (MIT) for the asset build.

## Animals
- Horse, Stork, Flamingo, Parrot — models and animation by mirada, from ROME (rome.mrdoob.com), as distributed in the three.js examples (github.com/mrdoob/three.js, examples/models/gltf) — `public/models/animals/`.

## Archive narrations
- Some narrations in this world are interpretive adaptations of channeled material from the L/L Research archive, voiced by AI. They are artistic interpretations, not the channeling itself. This is an independent work, not affiliated with or endorsed by L/L Research. The complete archive is freely available at llresearch.org.
- `public/audio/archetype_qa/` and `public/audio/passages/`: Samuel's archetype Q&A package (Aria): each archetype's teaching and practice, and the 21 passages between archetypes; transcripts in `content/archetype_qa.json` and `content/passages.json`.
- `public/audio/orbs/`: the 86 "Voices from the Archive" narrations (Aria), ep01–ep86, with transcripts and sources in `content/transcript_orbs.json`.

## Added 2026-09-27
- Ground scans (CC0, Poly Haven): Coast Sand 01, Forrest Ground 01, Aerial Rocks 02, Cliff Side (colour, normal, AO/roughness), re-encoded and high-passed for tiling.
- Voice: Piper text-to-speech (MIT, rhasspy/piper) with the "Cori" voice (en_GB-cori-high, from rhasspy/piper-voices; see its model card for its dataset licence).
